    Looking at the third layer at the door of the third layer, an old person with a white hair is staring at himself.     Chu Feng knows that this is the guardian Elder of the Martial Technique Pavilion. Don&#39;t look at his age, but the strength of the Elder is very strong.     “many thanks senior reminds that junior has its own size.”After Chu Feng’s polite salute, he went in.     &quot;Oh, it’s another arrogant discipline.&quot;Shouge Elder shook his head in disappointment.     Like the crime like Chu Feng, he saw more, but most of them ended in failure, lightly lost, and ruined, and ruined a good future.     Even so, whenever Elder sees a new face, he will be kindly reminded to avoid more disciples getting lost.     Chu Feng turned around in the third layer and quickly chose a favorite Martial Technique to get the registration in front of the Elder.     &quot;Are you sure you want to cultivate this illusory palm?&quot;Shouge Elder looked at Chu Feng with a puzzled look.     &quot;Mm.&quot;Chu Feng smiled and nodded.     “Have you seen this introduction to the Martalial Technique?”Elder continued to ask.     &quot;Back to Elder, the crime has seen it.&quot;Chu Feng smiled again.     &quot;Then you still choose it? This is the entire Martial Technique Pavilion, one of the hardest to cultivate. ”Elder said that he was puzzled.     &quot;Back to Elder, this precisely disciple wants to cultivate.&quot;Chu Feng always has a smile on his face, but his eyes are extremely firm.     &quot;Hey, the young people nowadays are really ignorant.&quot;Elder sighed, but still registered for Chu Feng. Before handing Martial Technique to Chu Feng, he added: “cultivation Martial Technique, remember to know how difficult it is to retreat.”    Chu Feng nodded and accepted. Although the Elder had always questioned Chu Feng, Chu Feng had a good impression of him and thought he was a responsible Elder.     &quot;Yeah?&quot;    But as Chu Feng turned around, a familiar figure passed him by, but Duan Yuxuan, and his face was very ugly.     Chu Feng was not familiar with him, so he didn&#39;t think much, but when he was about to leave, he whispered behind him, and he also got the reason why Duan Yuxuan was depressed.     &quot;That&#39;s not Duan Yuxuan. He doesn&#39;t have the Fourth Rank Martial Technique. How come here to pick the Martial Technique? Is it the Fourth Rank Martial Technique, where is Yang Tianyu? ”    &quot;You still don&#39;t know? At the time of the feast last night, the inner door Elder reminded them that the Four Rank Martial Technique could not be shared, only one person could be cultivated and returned soon. ”    &quot;Listen to Elder and say that they are both stupid. In the end, everyone clarified that they were not the first in the assessment, and that they killed the other 40 beasts.&quot;    &quot;There is still such a thing, why should they both admit it?&quot;    &quot;Hey, who knows this, maybe it&#39;s because of the face, but this time they are both shameful and thrown home.&quot;    &quot;Exactly, but who is the first one? The outside door seems to have never heard of such a powerful person? ”    &quot;Forty beasts, and there is also a fourth-order beast. I really can&#39;t imagine how fierce the man is?&quot;    Listening to this, Chu Feng shook his head with a smile and walked upstairs, eager to start cultivation.     The four floors are the same as the first floor. It is also very lively. Since the new discipline is mostly selected Martial Technique, it is all old discipline.     At first glance, it is not so much a floor, but rather a military field. There are thousands of people in the cultivation of the organs, and the sound of shouting is very spectacular.     Moreover, in addition to the thousands of organs in the hall, there are countless secret rooms around, which is also the place of cultivation.     This is a good design, likes to be lively, you can co-cultivation in the hall, and you can ask each other if you don&#39;t understand.     But like quiet, you can also choose a secret room to cultivation alone, and when the stone door is closed, it will isolate everything.     Chu Feng did not join them, but went to the sixth floor, here is the same as the third layer, relatively quiet, and the cultivation seat is much more.     Chu Feng walked into a secret room. After the stone gate was closed, he first bowed to the organ pile because he knew that the next pile would be devastated by him.     The organ pile is made of black iron wood and is extremely strong. As long as it attacks it, it will automatically evade.     And the speed of dodge will change according to the speed of the opponent&#39;s move. Unless Martial Technique cultivation is successful, it is difficult to hurt it. It is the best instrument of cultivation Martial Technique.     &quot;The illusory palm, with the power of the palm of the hand, the enemy is invisible.&quot;    Chu Feng once again looked at the cultivation method of the illusory palm, and this came to the organ pile.     &quot;Swish Swish.&quot;He suddenly shot, only to see the two palms into two illusions, facing the two points of the organ pile, slap away.     &quot;Whizzing.&quot;But at the moment that I was about to hit, the organ pile swayed around, and I quickly escaped the Chu Feng&#39;s attack.     At this moment, Chu Feng couldn&#39;t help but then laughed and said: &quot;A little meaning.&quot;    Since then, Chu Feng has stayed at this Martial Technique Pavilion and kept cultivation in addition to eating and sleeping.     The Thunder III, created by the Azure Dragon School ancestor, is extremely difficult, but cultivation is very difficult.     And the illusory palm, the reason why it will be called by the guard Elder, the Martial Technique of the most difficult cultivation of the Martial Technique, is not without reason.     However, after the first Rank time cultivation, Chu Feng has gradually learned the characteristics of the two Martial Techniques.     The Thunder three-style, extremely fierce, fast as thunder, as strong as a slap, each stroke can take enemy life, overbearing directly.     The illusory palm is the opposite, the virtual and the real alternate, hitting people by surprise.     Although it is not asformable as the Thunder III, it is also very good, and the mystery is different.     After a full ten days of cultivation, Chu Feng finally mastered two Martial Techniques.     The illusory palm does not say that Dacheng is also very similar, but it is the Thunder three-style, only cultivation to the second type.     But even so, when Chu Feng successfully exhibited the second style, it was also shocked by its powerful power.     The third layer of Martial Technique is still the Elder, and Chu Feng is returning the illusory palm.     &quot;How, hit the wall?&quot;Elder looked at Chu Feng with some irony, and his mouth was still proud.     Chu Feng didn&#39;t answer, but smiled casually, but in Elder&#39;s eyes, Chu Feng&#39;s smile is equal to the default.     &quot;Or go to the first floor, start with the First Rank Martial Technique.&quot;Taking back the Martial Technique, Elder reminded him kindly.     &quot;many thanks Elder.&quot;After Chu Feng gave a gift, he left.     &quot;It’s a bit savvy to know if it’s difficult to retreat.&quot;Looking at the back of Chu Feng&#39;s departure, the guard Elder nodded.     The Martial Technique is not open day and night. Whenever sunset, the Martial Technique Club will be closed. At this time, all the guards, Elder, will check the Martial Technique and the organ pile.     &quot;What a big fuss, I have to go see it myself.&quot;    &quot;Ouyang Elder, you must look at this, I haven&#39;t seen such a powerful discipline for a long time.&quot;    Above the stairs, a middle-aged man is leading a white-haired old person to a secret room on the sixth floor.     Within the secret room, an indestructible pile of organs was covered with scars and almost scrapped.     When I saw the organ pile, the white hair Elder&#39;s look became extremely dignified and looked up carefully.     这是But when he found out that the shallow palm prints, he was shocked.     The old-fashioned experience, he saw at a glance that this organ pile was injured by the illusory palm, but the entire inner door, able to cultivation of the illusory palm to this level of discipline, but few.     And, those who have achieved the Inner Sect Disciple, have long been outside the train, almost no cultivation in the Martial Technique.     After a long period of hard work, the Elder suddenly blinked and said: &quot;Is it him?&quot;
