    Chu Feng is not a Chu family, but a son of the Chu family who adopted the Chu Yuan.     This led to Chu Feng being squeezed from urinating and being bullied. If Chu Yuan did not maintain it, he was already driven out of the Chu family, so Chu Feng was extremely grateful to Chu Yuan and vowed to be the pride of Chu Yuan. Winning the light.     Chu Feng five years ago, just ten years old, the best age for carefully martial cultivation.     At that time, he was full of expectations for martial cultivation because he felt that it was time to prove himself.     But he never imagined that a month before he entered the Azure Dragon School, a Divine Lightning hit his body and entered his dantian.     At first, Chu Feng thought it was a good thing, because when he martial cultivation, he progressed quickly and reached the Spirit Realm Second Level in just two months.     This speed is beyond common sense, so that Chu Feng does not dare to tell anyone about this, but hides the power of cultivation.     However, the good times are not long. Just as Chu Feng thinks that he has become a martial cultivation genius, his body has changed.     This change causes his cultivation realm to stagnate and is considered a very talented generation.     &quot;Om&quot;    At this moment, the fairy grass in the hands of Chu Feng is being absorbed by his dantian.     The speed of refining and chemical processing is very fast, and it is far beyond common sense. Normally, with the strength of Chu Feng&#39;s, this fairy grass needs at least one month of refining.     But now it is only a moment, it has been refining, and Chu Feng is like a bottomless hole like Dan Tian, ​​and finally there is a feeling of being filled.     &quot;Om&quot;Suddenly, Chu Feng had a ray of light in his hand, and the half of the fairy grass was instantly dissipated.     At the same time, Chu Feng&#39;s Dantian has also undergone earth-shaking changes.     The nine Thunder Huge Beast were intertwined and rushed, and they were condensed, eventually turning into a Dan-like object.     After the formation of this Dan, a steady stream of aura, from which it rushed out, such as the tide generally washed Chu Feng&#39;s body, and soon penetrated the whole body.     &quot;Hey.&quot;    Chu Feng suddenly opened his eyes, and there was a trace of Thunder Light in his eyes, a kind of joy that could not be spoken, hung on his face.     “Successful, for five years, Chu Feng finally succeeded.”Chu Feng was so ecstatic that he suddenly jumped out of bed and walked back and forth on the ground while looking at his body.     A martial cultivation, known as Realm:    Spirit Realm, Origin Realm, Black Tortoise, Heaven Realm Four Realms, each Realm is divided into Ninth Level.     Spirit Realm First Level, which is mainly used to enhance the strength by exercising the body in a special way.     However, when you come to the Spirit Realm Second Level, you must use the law to condense the aura. Only if you succeed in condensing the aura into the dantian will you really enter the martial cultivation.     Chu Feng&#39;s body changes, carefully can not condense the aura, because his Divine Lightning in Dantian, like nine beasts of the hungry beast, Chu Feng condensed aura, will be swallowed by that Divine Lightning.     But he was not disheartened, because he found that Divine Lightning devours the aura, but there is a limit. As long as you keep instilling aura to Dantian, you can fill it up one day.     Today, he finally succeeded.     &quot;This feeling is so strong, a steady stream of aura, is running in the body, as if to break through.&quot;    Chu Feng felt incredible. He couldn&#39;t think of Divine Lightning&#39;s direct condensing into Dan, entrenched in Dantian, and Divine Lightning&#39;s gives out out of the aura, very rich, simply beyond imagination.     He knows that even if he is a five-year, sleepless cultivation, it is impossible to condense out, such a powerful aura, and the reason is so, precisely because of Divine Lightning.     &quot;Om&quot;At this moment, Chu Feng&#39;s body suddenly became stiff and his expression changed.     Divine Lightning is changing, his power has increased several times in an instant, and he has once again broken through and entered the Spirit Realm Fourth Level.     &quot;Is it hard to come?&quot;    Chu Feng clenched his fists and felt the explosive power in his body. He felt that it was worth the hard work in the past five years.     Continuously breaking through the two, this incredible way to become stronger, finally came back.     Suddenly, he turned his sharp eyes into the direction of the inner door, whispering: &quot;Chu Zhen, your fairy grass I have to fix.&quot;    Azure Dragon School recruits disciplines only once a year for 10 days.     After ten days, the annual internal door assessment will also begin, and this time, Chu Feng, who has been silent for five years, finally participate.     The assessment site is a huge underground palace, multitude within the hall of the underground palace, with tens of thousands of people.     Most of these people are Spirit Realm Third Level, because everyone knows that the internal door assessment must be at least Spirit Realm Third Level.     However, there are some disciplines of Spirit Realm Second Level, who want to fish in troubled waters. Everyone likes this every year, but most of them fail.     It is worth mentioning that there are still a small number of people who are Spirit Realm Fourth Level. They are not the slow-minded mediocrity of cultivation. On the contrary, some people are still geniuses.     They chose to participate in the internal door assessment when they were deliberately at the Spirit Realm Fourth Level. For the reason, it was for the reward.     Spirit Realm Third Level is already a cultivation Martial Technique.     Martial Technique is a powerful means of attack, not only to maximize the strength, but also to gain the power beyond the limits of the human body.     For this reason, the Martial Technique is very precious, and there is no such thing as a wealthy family. This is why the major families have to send descendants to sect.     Because there is a lot of Martial Technique in each sect, and in this Azure Dragon School, you can cultivate Martial Technique as long as you become Inner Sect Disciple.     However, the Martial Technique also has a grade, which is divided into Ninth Rank from weak to strong.     In the inner door, you can cultivate to the best, just the Third Rank Martial Technique.     However, in the annual internal assessment, the first one who passed the assessment can get a Fourth Rank Martial Technique.     Therefore, some people prefer to cultivation in the outer door and refuse to enter the inner door, which is the Fourth Rank Martial Technique.     &quot;Look, isn&#39;t that Yang Tianyu?&quot;    &quot;Wow, it’s really him. At the age of thirteen, he has reached the Spirit Realm Fourth Level. It seems that the first of this assessment is none other than him.&quot;    In the sea of ​​people, a young boy caught the attention of the people. To be precise, it was a boy.     Outer Sect Disciple has a few hundred thousand, most of which are obscure characters, but some people are the focus of attention. Most of these people are geniuses, and Yang Tianyu is one of them.     &quot;That may not be, he Yang Tianyu natural talent is good, but it is always a child, it is difficult to win the first.&quot;    &quot;Azure Dragon School Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, sometimes genius may not be able to compete for mediocrity, such as Duan Yuxuan.&quot;An Outer Sect Disciple, pointing his finger to an indifferent teenager.     This person is named Duan Yuxuan. He has been in the Azure Dragon School for six years. This is an unknown person.     Just a few months ago, he defeated a Spirit Realm Fourth Level Inner Sect Disciple, which became famous as the focus of the outside door.     be quietSuddenly, a loud voice sounded.     Looking at it, everyone couldn’t help but see more than a dozen figures on the high platform of the main hall.     Most of these people are elderly old people, but the outer door Elder, but the one who is headed, not only very young, but also a beautiful woman.     The woman put on a tight red dress and outlined the enchanting curve, especially under the skirt, the pair of straight white jade legs, perfect.     The woman is not only attractive, but also very flattering. The face of the apricot red lips is simply a standard fox face.     And she is Azure Dragon School&#39;s famous beauty Elder, Su Rou.     This Su Rou, but the number one, entered the Azure Dragon School at the age of ten, entered the inner door at the age of twelve, and became a core disciple at the age of fifteen.     But just as everyone is optimistic about her and feels that she is expected to be the first discriminator of Azure Dragon School, she suddenly made Elder.     For this change, no one knows the inside story, and it is still a mystery, and people are relished.     &quot;Wow, it turned out to be Su Rou Elder. Isn&#39;t she the inner door Elder? How can I come to the outer door? ”As soon as Su Rou appeared, all the male disciplines were wide open, and some even drooled.     Outer Sect Disciple, very young, mostly teenagers, some are children, for their age, Su Rou is such a mature and sexy woman, the most attractive.     Su Rou also has no Elder&#39;s shelf at all, but a flattering smile towards everyone, gentle way:    &quot;The assessment rules are very simple. I go in from the door behind me, and then pass the assessment from the door.&quot;    &quot;The only difference is that the first person who passed the assessment can get a Fourth Rank Martial Technique, which is not available in the inner door.&quot;    “But it’s worth mentioning that this year’s first place will receive another special prize.”    &quot;In a sense, this prize is even more precious than the first two.&quot; Here, Su Rou deliberately lengthened the tone, the temptation of the atmosphere, filled the entire hall.
