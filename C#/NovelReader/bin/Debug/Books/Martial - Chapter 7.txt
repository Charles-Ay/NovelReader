    It turned out that this Ouyang Elder is the old person registered for Chu Feng.     However, he has another identity, that is, the Head person of the Martial Technique Club.     He felt that it was Chchu Feng who was ruined by this organ, but he thought it was wrong if he thought about it.     After all, Chu Feng cultivation is only ten days, ten days, it is impossible to cultivation of the illusory palm to this point.     &quot;Ouyang Elder, come see this.&quot;Just when he was struggling to understand, the secret room next door came and called.     This does not matter, Ouyang Elder was once again shocked, because the organs of a secret room have been crushed.     &quot;Thunder three, second.&quot;    &quot;This Martial Technique is not learned in the inner door.&quot;This time, Ouyang Elder&#39;s face became serious.     This Thunder three style is the Martial Technique that can be cultivated by the core disciple. Now it appears in the inner door. Most of the descriptions are core disciple, which leaks the Martial Technique to the inner door.     But when you think about it, he thinks it is impossible. After all, Azure Dragon School is very law-abiding. If someone dares to divulge the Martial Technique, it can be quickly found out that the core disciple should not be confused to do this kind of thing.     Could it be thatFinally, Ouyang Elder found a chance, and Elder said behind him: &quot;Go to Su Rou Elder.&quot;    At the same time, Chu Feng is cultivating in his own room.     After an hour of refining, Chu Feng has continuously refining three Xianling grasses. If this scene is seen by outsiders, it will be stunned.     Because even if the martial cultivation expert refines a fairy grass, it will take at least one day, but Chu Feng will not be used for half an hour.     Moreover, Chu Feng refining the fairy grass, will be absorbed by Dantian, there is no waste.     This kind of thing, even the martial cultivation expert can&#39;t do it. It is said that ordinary people refining a fairy grass, which can absorb five tenths of aura is extremely good.     &quot;It seems that the price you have to pay to gain strength from you is enormous.&quot;Even so, Chu Feng is still somewhat helpless.     After refining the three Xianling grasses, he did not have the slightest breakthrough, and even felt that his Dantian was empty.     Can be changed to ordinary people, if you can completely absorb the aura of three Xianling grass, you can almost break through the Spirit Realm Fourth Level to the Spirit Realm Fifth Level.     This illustrates a problem. Divine Lightning gives Chu Feng far more power than ordinary people, but similarly, in order to improve the cultivation realm, Chu Feng also has to pay far more than ordinary people.     Aura, although Chu Feng can be condensed by law, even if it is a cultivation for a few months, it is far less than the aura contained in a fairy grass.     It can be seen that Chu Feng&#39;s cost to upgrade the cultivation realm is also a huge problem he will face.     &quot;Hey, is this the so-called advantage?&quot;    Looking at the two fairy grasses on the bed, Chu Feng really wanted to refine them, but he did not do this because he was preparing to return to Chu Yue.     “Chu Yue sister should move into the Spirit Realm Fifth Level, and these two grasses can help her.”Hesitating, Chu Feng packed up the fairy grass and blows the light to sleep.     The next morning, Chu Feng got up early, and he had two fairy grasses and wanted to find Chu Yue.     The inner door is too big. It is said that the Inner Sect Disciple is more than the Outer Sect Disciple, and there are enough thousand.     The vast palace complex is endless, looking for a person in this place, like a needle in a haystack.     &quot;Big Brother, you said that we want to join an alliance. After all, spiritual medicine hunting, people are more powerful.&quot;    &quot;It is very difficult to get out of joining the alliance. If the alliance is difficult in the future, we will be implicated.&quot;    &quot;That&#39;s also true, forget it, or go to the square to register first.&quot;A pair of young men who looked like brothers passed by Chu Feng, but the words they talked made Chu Feng happy.     “Two Senior Brothers, you just said that the spiritual medicine hunting started to sign up?”Chu Feng asked.     &quot;Yeah, the annual hunting medicine is not fixed, and this year is indeed earlier than in previous years.&quot;    &quot;Look, you are this year&#39;s new discipline? To sign up, just go with us. ”This pair of brothers are also enthusiastic.     &quot;Trouble two Senior Brothers.&quot;Chu Feng smiled politely, he was very happy.     The so-called spiritual medicine is the herbal medicine with aura. According to the different types, the spiritual medicine is divided into the following products: middle product, top grade, top grade, and Chu Feng&#39;s fairy grass is the top grade spiritual medicine.     As for the spiritual medicine hunting, it is a benefit of the Azure Dragon School for the Inner Sect Disciple.     At one point in the Azure Dragon Mountain Range, there is a large amount of spiritual medicine, and this area is called the spiritual medicine mountain.     Spiritual medicine Mountain, this is the forbidden place of Azure Dragon School, but it is open once a year, and all Inner Sect Disciple can sign up for participate.     The reason why it is called spiritual medicine hunting is because spiritual medicine is spiritual, can escape, runs at a high speed, and has strong aggression. It is very difficult to extract.     Now Chu Feng is most in need of spiritual medicine, the more the better, and this time the spiritual medicine hunting begins, it is a great news for him.     &quot;This Junior Brother, it seems that you have not joined the league, are you going to hunt alone?&quot;The brothers looked at Chu Feng.     &quot;What is wrong?&quot;Chu Feng is somewhat puzzled.     &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, this spiritual medicine hunting is not a one-person job. I advise you to join the league as well.&quot;The brothers kindly reminded.     The so-called alliance is an organization built by Inner Sect Disciple. Because this kind of organization can better close the relationship between the disciples, Azure Dragon School not only does not object to this kind of thing, but rather encourages it.     &quot;I just entered the inner door and I don&#39;t know much about the alliance. I don&#39;t know which alliances in the inner door are more powerful?&quot;Chu Feng asked curiously.     &quot;Haha, if you ask the right person, our brothers have just investigated the many alliances of the inner door.&quot;    &quot;According to the investigation, there are thousands of inner and outer leagues, the most powerful of which belong to the Alliance and the Kendo League.&quot;    &quot;The members of the Tianxia League are the most, with more than 5,000 people. The ones on the other side are written with the words of the world. They are members of the Alliance.&quot;    &quot;The members of the Kendo League are few, but there are at least a thousand people. The Kendo League is a bit special. If you want to join them, you must cultivate the Martial Technique with the sword. The other ones carrying the black iron sword are A member of the Kendo League.&quot;    &quot;The reason why these two alliances are the strongest is not only a large number of people, but the important thing is that the founders of these two alliances are the big names in my Azure Dragon School.&quot;    &quot;The two, who became core disciple ten years ago, are now among the best in the core disciple. They support them, and few people dare to move the League and Kendo League.&quot;    &quot;Big Brother, you are not right. Although the forces of the World League and Kendo League are very strong, I think the strongest should be the wing alliance.&quot;Just as his brother said the sound of color, Little Brother had a mouthful of comments.     &quot;Wing League is really powerful, but their number is too small. The so-called double fist is difficult to attack four hands. If there is a real conflict, they must not be the opponents of the League of Heaven and Kendo.&quot;My brother shook his head.     &quot;That may not be the case. Although the number of squad members is small, they are all dragons among people. They have the power of one enemy. I think that the alliance between the celestial alliance and the kendo alliance may not be the opponent of the squad.&quot;Little Brother replied.     &quot;Two, what is the head of this wing?&quot;Seeing the two people arguing endlessly, Chu Feng is more and more curious.     &quot;This Junior Brother, you listen to me, this wing is definitely the myth of my inner door.&quot;Upon seeing it, Little Brother grabbed Chu Feng and began to talk about it.
