    “Not just Immortal Execution Archipelago, even the people of the three big demon people are coming?”    &quot;Is it true that the three major demons have all formed an alliance with Immortal Execution Archipelago?&quot;Looking at the figure in Shanghai that day, Dong Xue was very surprised. Even her petite body at the moment was already a slight trembling of the difficult self-control. It can be seen how scared she is.     &quot;This is still asking, the three demon people have always been low-key, and never participated in the battle between humans. They mobilized so many democrats today to come here. It can be said that they are coming out.&quot;    &quot;Don&#39;t think about it, they must have formed an alliance with Immortal Execution Archipelago. It seems that this time, the other party is really newcomer.&quot;Xia Yu is not like Dong Xue, but Liu Mei is wrinkled and his eyes are full of anxiety.     &quot;It&#39;s you, they must come to catch you, you go out, don&#39;t impede us.&quot;Listening to this, Dong Xue was even more afraid, pointing the finger directly at Chu Feng and screaming.     &quot;Dong Xue Senior Sister, now is not a guilty time, not to mention the Master is on the Immortal Peak, even if they are large, we may not be afraid of them, you should not be so nervous.&quot;Upon seeing it, Qiu Zhu opened his mouth and advised.     “Qiu Zhu Senior Sister is right, what exactly is done, is the Master free to decide, can you use your mouth?”Chun Wu is also coldly snorted.     &quot;you……&quot;For Chun Wu, Dong Xue is very angry, but at the moment her timidity is far greater than her anger, so she did not argue with Chun Wu, but kept looking back and looking forward to Lady Piaomiao coming out.     Because the army outside is too strong at the moment, not only the number of people, but also the martial cultivation expert, full of tens of millions of martial cultivation expert, densely covered, it is terrible.     Even people who have been here have seen some big worlds, but they have never seen such a battle. If they say no fear, it is absolutely false.     Immortal Execution Archipelago That is now the recognized first force in the Eastern Sea Region.     As for the three great demon people, although they are low-key, they rarely communicate with human beings and have always guarded their own territory. It is not an exaggeration to say that they are isolated from the world.     However, their strength is unquestionable. Now Immortal Execution Archipelago, with the arrival of the three major demon people, who can block? Even if his guardian great formation is strong, Misty Peak is strong, but everyone is not at the bottom.     Don&#39;t look at it, some people say it is easy, but almost everyone, playing drums in their hearts, panic and uneasiness, is the mood of all people.     Chu Feng did not pay attention to the target of Dong Xue and others, because he did not have the time to pay attention to it. Chu Feng carefully observed the army of this Misty Peak at this moment.     Immortal Execution Archipelago has five Martial Kings.     One of them is the sixth singer. Chu Feng is familiar with him. At this moment, he is very good at standing here, indicating that he took several forbidden medicines on the same day, and there is no serious problem. At least his injury has been to recover completely. Correct.     Another one, like the sixth singer, is also the First Rank Martial King, which Chu Feng has not seen, but from the strength of the breath, Chu Feng thinks that he is probably the seventh sin of Immortal Execution Archipelago.     I wanted to get information from Depraved Ravine and Chun Wu. Immortal Execution Archipelago sent three Martial Kings. Among them, there was this seventh cent, but I don’t know why. The seventh fairy did not appear on the day, so this caused the war to be delayed. In the end, Chu Feng activated the great formation, which made Crippling Night Demon Sect win. Today, I finally saw the honor of the seven cents.     At the moment, on both sides of the sixth and seventh centuries, there are two old people dressed in Immortal Execution Archipelago robes, all of whom are old, but the cultivation realm is not the First Rank Martial King. The positions are Second Rank Martial King.     Although it is Second Rank Martial King, their atmosphere is weaker than the third fairy with Tantai Xue at the site of Burning Heaven Church, so Chu Feng concluded that they should be the fourth fairy of Immortal Execution Archipelago. The fifth cent.     Immortal Execution Archipelago&#39;s Nine immortals, now only seven, and today there are four.     Why say four, because the remaining Martial King of Immortal Execution Archipelago is obviously not one of Nine immortals.     The old person is also a white hair, but his face does not have a trace of wrinkles, a long special spirit, and the service he wears is also different.     Although it is somewhat different, it also depicts the Immortal Execution Archipelago logo on its clothes, especially the crown on his head, which is similar to the crown, which also depicts the Immortal Execution Archipelago logo.     The main thing is that the old person&#39;s breath is very strong, even stronger than You Mingdeng, because he doesn&#39;t hide the breath at the moment, so Chu Feng can tell, the strength of this is far from the four. Above the fairy, it is the Fifth Rank Martial King.     Such a powerful strength, as well as the special and noble service, the domineering crown, and the respectful attitude of the Immortal Execution Archipelago, do not think much, Chu Feng also knows who this person is.     Presumably, he is the father of Murong Xun, the island owner of Immortal Execution Archipelago - Murong Niekong! ! !     In addition to the Immortal Execution Archipelago, the three major demons have also come a lot.     The two Protectors of the Flame God Birds came. In addition to these two Protectors, there are three Martial Kings, two of which are Second Rank Martial King, and the last one is the Fourth Rank Martial King, which is wearing a golden feather coat. Uncommon, there is a posture that is equal to Murong Niekong, and he is probably the Clan Head of the Flame Birds.     As for the Boulder Mutation Beast clan and the Blood-Scale Monstrous Fish clan, there are more Martial Kings than the Flames and the Immortal Execution Archipelago, and they sent six Martial King strongmen.     And two of them are also the Fourth Rank Martial King, and that special and noble dress, unlike other tribes, can be seen, the Clan Head of these two demons also came.     Immortal Execution Archipelago, the three big demon, the strongest characters have come to the scene, this lineup is already very scary.     However, Chu Feng noticed that there was a figure in the army at the moment, and even this figure made Chu Feng even more uneasy.     This is a young man, standing behind the strong Martial King, next to Murong Xun, his position is not eye-catching, but the man who never met, will be Immortal Execution Archipelago The Islands Young Master is nothing more than nothing.     The man’s age is certainly less than 30 years old and younger than Murong Xun.     Moreover, he is not only tall, but also handsome, especially the sword eyebrows, full of heroism, more handsome than Murong Xun.     The most important thing is that although the man&#39;s breath is secret, Chu Feng still finds that he is actually a Fourth Rank Martial King, and the atmosphere is richer than the Clan Head of the three majors. So old, have this Cultivating realm, really can&#39;t imagine.
