    After Su Rou and others left, the hall fell silent.     After a long time, a rushing tread was heard outside the hall, and a discipline ran in quickly.     This person is Duan Yuxuan, but at the moment he is quite different from the one before entering the underground palace.     The hair was messy, sweaty, and gasping with a big mouth, like a madman, went straight to the high platform and flew away.     &quot;Haha, the first is mys, Yang Tianyu, you are a kid, want to fight with me?&quot;    &quot;When you have been in the outer door for six years, what is it for?&quot; I tell you now, Lao Tzu is the fucking one. ”    Duan Yuxuan ran, cheering as if he was a demon, his eyes gazing at the high platform, and he ignored the carcass of the beast in the hall.     &quot;Hey.&quot;He jumped up and steadily fell on the high platform.     But when he smiled and swept his gaze to his feet, he was as dull as a blue sky.     Because on the high platform, it was empty and there was no root hair.     Tch, what was this situation?    After a long time, he only came back to God. Only then did he find that the bottom of the high platform was full of blood, and the bodies of forty beasts were scattered throughout the hall.     And the death of each beast, it is thrilling, bloody.     This scene, frightened him, actually plop sat on the high platform, looked back, only to find that the door to pass the assessment, did not open.     &quot;what on earth is it?&quot;Duan Yuxuan was overwhelmed and his thoughts were messy.     &quot;Tread on step...&quot;Just then, Yang Tianyu also ran over, but he just stopped at the door of the hall and stopped.     Looking at the scene in the hall, and looking at Duan Yuxuan above the high platform, he was stunned: &quot;This:Is this what you do? ”    Duan Yuxuan chuckled and said: &quot;If I said no, do you believe?&quot;    &quot;Of course, you can&#39;t have such a strong strength.&quot;Yang Tianyu glanced at him and walked into the hall to check the body of the beast: &quot;Oh God!, there is still a fourth-order beast. Whose hand is this?&quot;    The two have been observing for a long time, but they have never been able to come up with an answer. They can&#39;t think of being in the outer door. Who will have such terrible strength.     At the end of the day, they even suspected that this was the bureau set by the Elders, and that Elder had swallowed the first prize.     But when the discipline of the Spirit Realm Third Level arrived, a dramatic scene took place.     Everyone thought that Yang Tianyu and Duan Yuxuan killed the beasts, and the reward for the first place was divided equally between them.     But the best thing to laugh about is that Yang Tianyu and Duan Yuxuan did not deny the gaze of the people. It was so inexplicably the first.     The door was opened and the cheers followed. Everyone was very happy, because as soon as they walked out of the gate, they became the Inner Sect Disciple and ushered in a new life.     But just as people cheered, a teenager who came out of the underground palace caught people&#39;s attention.     He was naked, and he was crying. He was full of grievances and cursed: &quot;Who is fucking so wicked, behind me, I don’t say a sap, but I also smashed people’s clothes. How can I be so perverted?&quot;    For such a scene, people are very surprised. Only Chu Feng smiled and looked at the unscathed clothes and quietly left the crowd.     The internal door assessment ended, and the number of assessors was tens of thousands, and only 2,000 people passed the assessment, but this is not a small number.     Entering the inner door, it became the official definition of Azure Dragon School, and also enjoyed superior treatment.     In order to welcome the new discipline to join the inner door, the Elders also made a special feast.     On the night sky, the moon hangs high, and the songs and dances in the inner door rise to the level, bringing the atmosphere of joy to the extreme.     However, this feast Chu Feng was not participate, but stayed in his new mansion, bare upper body and observed his wounds.     The wound is healing and healing quickly, so that it can be completely to recover completely in a few days, and such resilience is precisely given by Divine Lightning.     &quot;What exactly are you? Why choose me? ”    This question is not the first time Chu Feng has asked. He has asked this question numerous times, but he has never got an answer.     He still remembers the night of Azure Province, five years ago, over the Nine-colored Divine Lightning.     The sky is as bright as white, the thunder dances like a dragon, the sky is thundering and roaring, the earth can&#39;t stop shaking, people think that the end of the day, panic, chaos.     But only Chu Feng, who was ten years old, could not help but ran out of the house and went to an open place.     Even now, he doesn&#39;t know why he did it at the beginning, just like there is a kind of magic that is attracting him to go there.     Later, he was possessed by Divine Lightning.     No one saw that scene, but he knew that the inside of Dantian must be the sensation of the whole continent, Nine-colored Divine Lightning.     Divine Lightning gave Chu Feng a strong body, but Chu Feng never understood why such a powerful thing should be attached to his body.     &quot;Forget it, since you don&#39;t answer, I will stop asking, anyway, you and me are already one.&quot;    Chu Feng smiled and smiled. It is a blessing that is not a curse. It is a curse. If this Divine Lightning is really bad for him, he can&#39;t resist it with his strength.     What&#39;s more, the Divine Lightning has brought him all the benefits so far, so he simply doesn&#39;t think too much.     Chu Feng put on her clothes and turned her eyes to a book on the bed. The book was written in four characters, &quot;Thunder Three.&quot;    Picking up the book and Chu Feng flipping through it, this is his first contact with the Martial Technique, and his mood is somewhat excited.     “Fourth Rank Martial Technique, Thunder III, created by Azure Dragon Founder.”    &quot;Repairing to Dacheng is as fast as thunder and as strong as the Fifth Rank Martial Technique.&quot;    Looking at the introduction of a few lines, Chu Feng took a breath and was surprised: &quot;This is actually the Martial Technique created by the founding father!&quot;    Azure Dragon Founder is the founder of this Azure Dragon School. It was a million-year-old to move unhindered continent invincible. It has the power to fly and reclaim the sea. It is a real martial cultivation expert.     At that time, Azure Dragon School, led by Azure Dragon Founder, was the first sect of Nine Provinces Continent.     The only thing that can compete with Azure Dragon School is Nine Provinces Continent, now Overlord, Jiang Dynasty.     However, it didn&#39;t last long. After the death of Azure Dragon Founder, Azure Dragon School began to decline and quickly fell into the top sect of Nine Provinces Continent.     Even in this Azure Province, it is only a second-class sect, but it also shows the personal strength of Azure Dragon Founder.     The Martial Technique created by his old man is a masterpiece of the Martial Technique, which can be met.     Excited, Chu Feng rushed to read the cultivation method and vowed to practice the Thunder.     After a night of sleep, Chu Feng finally understood the cultivation method of the Thunder.     One type is type, two types are meaning, and three types can be used to thunder. In general, this thunder three-type cultivation is extremely difficult, but Chu Feng wants to try it.     After washing, Chu Feng was not sleepy, so he went to the Martial Technique Pavilion at the inner door.     First of all, the Martial Technique has facilities for the cultivation Martial Technique. In addition, because the Thunder is not exposed, he needs to cultivate a different Martial Technique to hide his eyes and ears.     &quot;It’s really lively.&quot;Into the Martial Technique Pavilion, the eyes suddenly open, the vast Martial Technique Pavilion, has been overcrowded.     However, this is also reasonable. After all, there are more than 2,000 disciplines joining the inner door yesterday. These new disciplines, most of which are cultivation, are Martial Technique.     Martial Technique is divided into six layers, a layer of First Rank Martial Technique, second layer Second Rank Martial Technique, third layer Third Rank Martial Technique, as for the four or five layers, it is the place of cultivation Martial Technique.     Chu Feng all the way up, found that one layer is full of people, the second layer is much better, as for the third layer, it is already rare.     This is expected, although the Martial Technique has different powers, but the difficulty of cultivation is different.     So many people will start from the beginning, first cultivation First Rank Martial Technique, wait until after Dacheng, then choose Second Rank, and finally cultivation Third Rank.     However, Chu Feng&#39;s goal is very clear, even if it is only used for self-defense, but he also has to choose the strongest.     &quot;Young people, I advise you not to be too far-reaching, the Martial Technique here is not for you.&quot;But Chu Feng just stepped into the third layer, and an old voice came into the ear.
