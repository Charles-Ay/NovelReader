    Chu Feng has heard about the name of the beast.     It is a monster that can be cultivated. It is divided into nine steps from weak to strong, and corresponds to the Cultivator of Spirit Realm Ninth Level.     However, it is said that the strength of the third-order beast can be far stronger than the Spirit Realm Third Level Cultivator, and even compete with the Spirit Realm Fourth Level expert.     Therefore, even if Chu Feng does not dare to care, he knows that there are organs here, as long as the beast is triggered, it will appear.     Suddenly, a muffled sound came and a stone door holding the beast was opening.     &quot;Strange, I haven&#39;t stepped into the hall yet, how did the stone door open?&quot;Chu Feng is surprised.     &quot;Hey...&quot;However, immediately afterwards, a total of forty stone doors on both sides of the main hall were opened.     This time Chu Feng was dumbfounded, because in those dark stone gates, a pair of blood red eyes had been opened, and a powerful murderous gas filled the entire hall.     &quot;I fuck, isn&#39;t this playing me?&quot;Chu Feng is cursed, he clearly heard that the last level of each assessment is a fierce beast, but now is a situation.     &quot;呜嗷~~~&quot; But at the moment, Chu Feng has no time to think too much, because the dense figure has been pulled out from the stone door and entered the hall.     He can clearly see that this group of monsters looks like a tiger, but it is twice as big as a tiger.     The body was dark, and only the sharp claws and fangs, as well as a pair of blood-red eyes, were visible.     A total of forty beasts, their appearance is no different, should be the same as the First Rank, but after careful observation, Chu Feng found that their foreheads have strange lines, obviously that is their mark of the order.     &quot;Wow 喔~&quot; Just then, a fierce beast roared and turned his eyes to the high platform in the depths of the hall.     At the same time, the eyes of all the beasts were cast on the high platform, and the coveted color was revealed.     &quot;Rely, you robbers.&quot;Upon seeing it, Chu Feng was furious, so how could he let these beasts enjoy it, roar and rush to the high platform.     &quot;呜嗷&quot; and when Chu Feng just entered the hall, it quickly caught the attention of the beast.     This can be done well, full of forty beasts, and at the same time give up the fairy grass, all siege to Chu Feng, as if for them, human flesh and blood is more tempting than spiritual medicine.     “Get away!”A second-order beast came on the scene, but Chu Feng just punched his head and was completely vulnerable.     But at the same time, a full number of fierce beasts have been besieged, and that terrible murder is enough to scare a person to tremble.     However, Chu Feng is not afraid. He is as strong as a monkey, and his left and right jumps are in the group of fierce beasts. Every time he makes a move, there must be a beast.     At this moment, compared with the cruel beast, Chu Feng is more like a terrible monster. His body is an indestructible weapon. Even if the beast is thick and thick, he can&#39;t resist him. one strike.     At this moment, Chu Feng can feel that the body is not only the aura of heaven and earth, but also the Nine-colored Divine Lightning that makes him love and hate. Precisely this Divine Lightning gives him such powerful power to bring him to the flesh. Perfect forging.     &quot;吼&quot; was just when Chu Feng killed the eyes, and suddenly there was a harsh roar behind him.     He turned around and couldn&#39;t help but be shocked. A huge fierce beast and claws were caught on his head.     This giant claw is different from others. It is many times stronger than other beasts. If it is caught by it, the head must be crushed.     &quot;Hey.&quot;Chu Feng subconsciously squatted back and wanted to avoid this giant claw.     However, the speed of the giant claws was too fast. Although Chu Feng&#39;s head escaped the attack, it was caught on Chu Feng&#39;s chest.     &quot;Hey~~&quot; The chest was torn apart from five bloody wounds. The fatal pain made Chu Feng unable to scream.     &quot;I want to tear you up.&quot;However, in addition to the pain, Chu Feng is more angry.     He has seen that the beast that attacked him has four lines on his forehead, which shows that this is a fourth-order beast.     Change to be someone else, be sure to turn around and run, because even if it is the same Realm, but the power of the beast is definitely stronger than humans.     But Chu Feng not only did not escape, but madly rushed to the fierce beast, his unwilling move, even the fierce beasts without intelligence, is also a subconscious glimpse.     dang    However, it was the fierce beast&#39;s martial arts, and Chu Feng hit the forehead with a punch.     Unexpected blood spattered, but there was a loud noise like a steel collision.     Even Chu Feng felt a numbness in his fist, as if his fist was not on the head of the beast, but on the wall of the copper wall.     &quot;呜嗷~&quot;    However, Chu Feng&#39;s fist is also a small feat. The fierce sorrow of the fierce beast has turned back a few steps back. Obviously it also feels pain.     &quot;Give me to die.&quot;    Seeing that his attack still has a role, Chu Feng no longer keeps his hands, picking up his arms, and the fists of the sky begin to fly around. The heavy fists are like rainstorms, and they are constantly squatting on the beast.     I have to say that Chu Feng&#39;s explosive power is too strong. Under his crazy attack, the beast that is several times bigger than him is even back down, even wanting to attack his beast, and it is undoubtedly punched. And kill him alive.     At the end of the day, there were forty beasts, and all of them were hit by the land. Most of them were in the same place, and the death was extremely fierce.     Although the body of the fourth-order beast is still intact, the huge head is also beaten by Chu Feng.     &quot;Chu Hu&quot; Chu Feng at the moment, standing in a pool of blood, panting with a big mouth.     After a bloody battle, his body had several more shocking wounds, but they were not fatal. Even in addition to the attack of the fourth-order beast, the wounds caused by other beasts were just simple skin injuries. Into the meat.     &quot;I am so afraid of the body, how many formidable?&quot;    This is what Chu Feng asks himself. Compared to the beasts, he feels more like a steel bar.     This body is beyond the limits of humanity, and he once again realizes his particularity.     Looking around, Chu Feng jumped onto the high platform. He didn&#39;t look at it, and he took the Martial Technique and the fairy grass into his arms.     After doing this, Chu Feng did not open the closed door, but returned to the road and walked into the agency.     However, just after Chu Feng left, a stone room that closed the beasts, but walked out more than a dozen figures, headed by the precisely Su Rou.     At this moment, whether it is Su Rou or the group of old Elder, their looks are weird.     Although I only saw that Chu Feng was facing the dead fourth-order beast, he kept his fists.     But as long as I think that so many powerful beasts have been killed by a teenager, they are still incredible.     &quot;Elder Li, who is that child?&quot;Su Rou asked.     Elder Li didn&#39;t answer, but looked at the other Elders behind him, but the Elders all made the move.     &quot;This excellent discipline, you really don&#39;t know what he is called?&quot;Su Rou&#39;s brows are slightly unpleasant.     &quot;Outer Sect Disciple is too much. If he intends to retain his strength, we also...&quot;Elder Li is also helpless.     &quot;Forget it, find out his details as soon as possible, then tell me.&quot;    &quot;And, since he doesn&#39;t want to expose his cultivation realm, as he wishes, don&#39;t let him know, we understand his strength.&quot;Su Rou shouted.     OKElder Li and others Respectfully, they don&#39;t dare to disrespect the inner door Elder.     Su Rou took a meaningful look, and Chu Feng left the direction, which was thoughtfully walked into the stone room.
