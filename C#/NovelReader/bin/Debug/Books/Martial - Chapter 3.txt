		Martial God Asura&#39;s latest chapter, Divine Body Chapter 3 Assessment begins (plus 1), Astronomy
    &quot;What exactly is it?&quot;Someone asked curiously.     “Do Su Rou Elder have to dedicate himself?”More shameless, actually want to enter the wrong.     Although Su Rou is Elder, she is only 20 years old. Compared with the old antiques in sect, she is more approachable. Because of this, many people will talk without any scruples.     For everyone&#39;s guess, Su Rou just smiled and stretched out five thin fingers, saying: &quot;Five plants of fairy grass.&quot;    &quot;What? Five Xianling Grass? ”    &quot;I didn&#39;t get it wrong? Is it a fairy grass, or five? ”As soon as this was said, the hall was in chaos and everyone could not calm down.     The fairy grass is so precious, even the Chu family can only subsidize one person per year.     For ordinary people, the fairy grass is even more invaluable, and I have never seen it.     At the moment, Azure Dragon School has come up with five, which is not a big temptation for Outer Sect Disciple.     It is only for most people, they can only think about it, because they all know that the fairy grass is not with them.     But those who are aiming at the first disciples are eager to try and become more excited.     Seeing that the disciplines were so high, Su Rou nodded with satisfaction, and then he waved.     Behind him, there was a sound of &quot;rumbling&quot;, and the door that was as high as a few feet was slowly opening.     &quot;What are you waiting for? Do you want to pass the assessment? ”Looking at the sluggish disciples, Su Rou smiled.     Come on!    For a time, the bursts of cheers resounded constantly, and tens of thousands of Outer Sect Disciple, like the wild horses, rushed into the gate.     Chu Feng followed the crowd, all the way forward, and finally entered a deep cave.     This cave is very wide, but it is very dim and the visibility is extremely low. People know the danger of lurking and may come at any time.     &quot;Chong, for the Fourth Rank Martial Technique, for five grasses, rush ~~~&quot;    However, there are always people who want money and don’t want to die. They know that there is danger, they are still leading the way, they don’t even return, and such people are not in the minority.     &quot;Swish Swish 唰&quot;    Just a hundred meters ahead, the sound of breaking the wind came from the front, and countless silver needles came out from the rock wall, and it shot like a storm.     &quot;Ahhhh…&quot;    &quot;Wa Wa ~~~~&quot;    For a time, all kinds of screams resounded, and the disciples in front of them were caught off guard, and they were already down.     Even so, people are still as before, without the slightest retreat, the desperate caves rushing deep.     Because they know that this silver needle is powerful, but it is not fatal. After all, it is an institution. For those of Spirit Realm Third Level, just be careful and avoid it.     With the continuous deepening, the number of silver needles is becoming more and more dense, and people who often play are caught off guard.     In this case, the crowd quickly opened the distance, running in the forefront is not a generation of fish and fish, but Yang Tianyu, Duan Yuxuan and other experts.     I have to say that Yang Tianyu and Duan Yuxuan and others are indeed extraordinary.     Others need to be careful when walking in the rainy silver needle.     But they are on the ground, and where is the squad, it’s just a few people racing.     Chu Feng has been behind them, trailing the army of Spirit Realm Third Level for two reasons.     First, don&#39;t want to make a head bird.     Second, his situation is very special, and he does not want to expose his strength too early.     So he is waiting for an opportunity, one can&#39;t see anyone, but he can surpass everyone&#39;s timing.     &quot;Duan Yuxuan, you are so old, you can&#39;t run me a child, don&#39;t you feel shameful?&quot;    &quot;Hey, kid, martial cultivation, regardless of age, only talk about strength, to speak big, first win me.&quot;    After the first Rank time shuttle, the front of the team, only two figures left, that is Duan Yuxuan and Yang Tianyu.     Both of them are Spirit Realm Fourth Level, a talented and experienced, two people, the gunpowder is getting more and more    Because they know that the biggest competitor is the other party, as long as they win the other party, the first reward is theirs.     &quot;Call ~~~~~~&quot;Suddenly, the sound of the wind came from the front.     Looking at the eyes and watching, both of them were shocked, and they could not help but slow down the pace at the foot, because in the front, there was a strong fog.     This cave is dim, plus fog, the visibility is even lower, which greatly increases the difficulty of evading the organization, even if they are two, must be treated with caution.     &quot;good chance.&quot;    But when everyone retreats, Chu Feng is a sneak peek. He strides forward and listens only to the slamming sound. The whole person flies away like an arrow in the string.     &quot;Hey.&quot;    At this moment, Duan Yuxuan was concentrating on avoiding the silver needle, but a black shadow flashed past him, and he did not wait for him to react. The man was gone.     “Is it an illusion?”    Such a scene made Duan Yuxuan feel amazed and began to think that it was Yang Tianyu, but when Yang Tianyu was still not far away, he became stunned.     Sustaining everyone, Chu Feng has no worries, he mentioned the speed to extreme.     After a long run, he did not feel exhausted, the aura of the body was inexhaustible, and it continued to overflow from Dantian.     Not only that, his speed and strength, hearing and vision are far superior to those of the same cultivation realm, at least far better than that of Yu Xuan and Yang Tianyu.     For this change, Chu Feng is not too surprised because this precisely his special part.     This kind of speciality, he has seen it five years ago, and now this special return gives him a very strong self-confidence, because in front of him, no one can claim to be a genius.     All the way to the flow, Chu Feng finally crossed the array of institutions, walked out of the deep and dark caves, and came to a wide hall.     At the end of the main hall, there is a stone high platform, with several items placed on the high platform, precisely Fourth Rank Martial Technique, and five Xianling grass.     Chu Feng was a little excited to see these things, but he did not rush to move forward, but looked at the stone gates on either side of the main hall.     &quot;After that, is the beast in the legend?&quot;Chu Feng&#39;s mouth has a look of anticipation.     He knows that this assessment has only just begun. What he will face is a bloodthirsty, cruel and terrifying creature called the beast.     “Su Rou Elder is coming to see it, it’s amazing.”    &quot;I have been here for so many years, and I saw for the first time that the discipline can be cleared at such a speed.&quot;    Underground palace A hidden stone room, an elderly Elder, staring at a mess of stones, his eyes filled with shock.     It is not an ordinary stone, but an organ in the underground palace. Only when the organ is triggered will the stone be confused.     At the moment, the entire stone is in disorder, that is to say one thing, someone has passed the agency.     In the assessment of previous years, the fastest time to pass the organs also has an hour, but at this moment, only half an hour has passed.     This change caused everyone&#39;s attention. A dozen of Elders in the stone room gathered all over, and they were all surprised.     &quot;It seems that there is an interesting character in this Outer Sect Disciple.&quot;    Su Rou also came over. She looked at the sloppy stone and nodded with satisfaction: &quot;If you do, you can&#39;t let him pass easily, let me add some fun to him.&quot;    Between the talks, she turned her eyes to the top of the stone, where there were three round stones embedded in the stone wall.     Suddenly, she smiled awkwardly and took a picture of the three stones.     &quot;do not touch.&quot;Upon seeing it, Elder was shocked.     However, it was too late, and at the moment three stones were pressed by Su Rou.     What’s the matter? Didn&#39;t you tell me that this stone can release a beast?&quot;Looking at the panic look of the crowd Elder, Su Rou also realized that it was wrong.     &quot;These three stones can indeed release the beast, but they cannot be triggered at the same time.&quot;    &quot;If it is triggered at the same time, all the beasts that are being held will be released.&quot;    &quot;That is thirty second-order beasts, nine third-order beasts, and a fourth-order beast.&quot;When he said this, Elder Li was pale, and even the voice was a little trembling.     He has been here for many years and he knows the beast very well.     That is a savage and terrible monster, far more powerful than the same level of Cultivator.     At the moment, so many fierce beasts are released at the same time, and a killing is inevitable.     Just think that the tens of thousands of disciplines in the underground palace at the moment are about to be slaughtered by the beasts. He simply can&#39;t continue thinking about it.     &quot;Why don&#39;t you remind me early.&quot;    At this moment, Su Rou&#39;s face is also a big change. When she is petite, she turns into a blast. When the stone door opens, she is gone.     &quot;Elder Li, what should I do?&quot;Everyone&#39;s eyes are condensed on the old Elder.     &quot;What can I do? I am not going to rescue.&quot;Elder Li screamed and rushed out.
