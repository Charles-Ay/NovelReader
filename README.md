### More sites?

Yeah, ill add some more when I get around to it. You can raise a issue if you really want a specific one. Please try to make sure that the websites you request meet mostof the following criteria(its a headache to work with sites that dont and I don't want to add a webdriver as that add lots of overhead)
- Supports HTTP Request and doesnt hide the content inside obscure Java-Script **Cough, Cough** WuxiaWorld
- Should have some sort of search function(like a search bar)
- The chapters should have some logical ordering/naming. Not something like https://trashnovelsite.com/novel/32113/chapter-3. This makes it so much harder to get the right novel

**Note:** Your request may be denied in case of Cloudflare protections and powerful anti-bot scripts(ew).
