		Martial God Asura Latest chapter, Divine Body Chapter 1 Outer Sect Disciple, Astronomy
    At night, the moon is hanging high and the stars are a little bit.     But between the stars, there are nine-color Thunder Lights that linger, which is especially dazzling.     &quot;The vision of the heavens is that there will be a deity.&quot;    Nine Provinces Continent, the top of the Imperial City, a gold-shirt old person standing with his hands on his back, looking up at the night sky.     Behind him, there are tens of thousands of Imperial City experts, neatly half-squatting on the ground, seemingly waiting for orders.     &quot;Om&quot;    Suddenly, Thunder Light condensed and turned into a Nine-colored Divine Lightning, which fell from the Nine Heavens.     In an instant, the night turned white, Divine Lightning had not yet fallen, and the earth was beginning to rumbling and trembled violently.     But when the Nine-colored Divine Lightning, the glimpse of the continent, did not cause terrible damage, it disappeared out of thin air.     At the same time, the earth was once again shrouded in the night, and the night sky of Benedict was dimmed a lot, as if some essence had been taken away, and the calm of the past was restored.     But at this moment, the eyes of the old person are very bright, and even the excited body is shaking. The whereabouts of his finger thunder: &quot;In the territory of Azure Province, all the children who come tonight, bring me back to the Imperial City!&quot;    OK    The thunderous response rang through the sky, and tens of thousands of imperial city experts went to Azure Province to vow to find the gods and use them for the dynasty.     Time has passed, and it has been five years since the blink of an eye. Although people still remember the scene of the year, no one knows what the dynasty did.     Nine Provinces Continent, Azure Province, sect stands out, and Azure Dragon School is one of them.     Today, I went to Azure Dragon School once a year, recruiting the days of discipline, outside Azure Dragon School, multitude.     But at this time, the most busy one is the Outer Sect Disciple, and all the receptions of the sect are on their heads.     Outer Sect Disciple is an unforgettable errand. Let&#39;s not say that the status of sect is low, even outsiders look down on them.     The reason is very simple. Anyone who is Outer Sect Disciple shows that the natural talent is extremely poor, and it is difficult to achieve great achievements in life. It is naturally despised.     &quot;Hey, what is your attitude, do you know who I am?&quot;A gorgeous woman, with a boy, pointed at a teenager and shouted loudly.     &quot;I am sorry, it is too late, sect will be closed, and the two will come again tomorrow.&quot;The handsome face of the youngster is still young, but there is a touch of British spirit between the eyebrows.     His name is Chu Feng, which is fifteen years old and is one of the tens of thousands of Outer Sect Disciple at Azure Dragon School.     But the same as Outer Sect Disciple, this Chu Feng is different, there is no inferior inferiority, no self-deprecating indulgence, treating everyone is not afraid, not calm.     &quot;Come back tomorrow, you are an idiot?&quot; Where do you let our mother and son live in this deep mountain? ”    &quot;You have to arrange accommodation for me, or I will go to your Elder theory.&quot;The woman did not care, but she grabbed Chu Feng&#39;s clothes.     &quot;Chu Feng, are you in trouble?&quot;But at this moment, a sweet voice suddenly sounded.     Looking at it, a purple girl, is coming, although her mouth is smiling, but the pair of sharp eyes, but staring at the woman.     When I saw the girl, the woman’s face suddenly changed, and a thick fear emerged.     Not because of anything else, only because of the purple robes on the girl, that is the sign of the Inner Sect Disciple.     The woman screamed badly, and thought that her identity could make her a teenager.     I used to think that this inconspicuous teenager had the Inner Sect Disciple as the backstage, but that she could not afford it.     &quot;It&#39;s okay, I just asked the little brother about something.&quot;The woman smiled and explained.     The girl first glanced at her and then only said one word: &quot;Roll.&quot;    At this moment, the woman&#39;s body could not help but tremble, and her face became iron.     However, she did not hesitate, and took the boy and quickly walked away. There was still a fall between the panic and the wolf.     Upon seeing, Chu Feng shook his head helplessly, and then prayed to the girl next to him: &quot;many thanks Chu Yue Senior Sister&quot;    &quot;You are kind to me, we are a family.&quot;Chu Yue is not happy.     She is right, Chu Feng and she are indeed a family, they are from the same family, Chu family.     This Chu Yue handmade Chu Feng is the cousin of Erbojia, only one year older than Chu Feng.     However, Chu Yue passed the internal door assessment three years ago and became the Inner Sect Disciple. Now it is the expert of the Spirit Realm Fourth Level.     &quot;Sect rules, always have to comply.&quot;Chu Feng smiled brilliantly.     &quot;哎&quot; However, looking at such Chu Feng, Chu Yue is a bit of a heart: &quot;Chu Feng brother, this year&#39;s internal door assessment you are not participate? Don&#39;t you have reached the Spirit Realm Third Level? ”    Chu Feng did not answer, his face still has a smile, no one knows what meaning he is.     Upon seeing, Chu Yue took a kit from his waist and put it in Chu Feng&#39;s hands: &quot;Refining it, maybe helping you break through the Third Level.&quot;    Chu Feng opened the kit, and suddenly a compelling aura gave out, a finger-sized, crystal-clear fairy grass is lying in it.     &quot;Chu Yue sister, this is too expensive, I can&#39;t.&quot;Chu Feng rushed back to Chu Yue.     Essence grass is a martial cultivation medicine, extremely precious, and has endless effects on the Cultivator within Spirit Realm.     In order to allow them to quickly upgrade the cultivation realm, the Chu family subsidizes each of them each year.     I want to come to Chu Yue, which is also a family subsidy. It is only that Chu Yue did not enjoy it. Instead, it was given to him. This made Chu Feng feel moved and could not bear to accept it.     &quot;I said to you, you are holding, or is it my Little Brother.&quot;Chu Yue is not happy.     &quot;Hey, when is Chu Yue sister so generous, and the fairy grasses have to be sent?&quot;    &quot;Look, I am also your Little Brother. I have just broken through the Spirit Realm Fourth Level recently. Why is it that Chu Yue sister sent me this fairy grass?&quot;    A teenager of the same age as Chu Feng came over and wore the clothing of Inner Sect Disciple.     His name is Chu Zhen, also from the Chu family. He joined Afure Dragon School with Chu Feng five years ago, but he became an Inner Sect Disciple two years ago.     &quot;Chu Zhen, you have already broken through the Spirit Realm Third Level and succeeded in agitation. Even without this fairy grass, you can skyrocket.&quot;    &quot;Chu Feng brother has not yet gathered aura, this fairy grass is more important to him.&quot;Chu Yue forced the fairy grass into the hands of Chu Feng&#39;s.     &quot;Yeah, you are right, but unfortunately he does not lead you.&quot;Chu Zhen spread his hands and sneered.     &quot;Who said that I don&#39;t want it.&quot;However, Chu Feng smiled slightly, and unceremoniously put the fairy grass into his arms, and then said: &quot;Chu Yue sister, this fairy grass is what I borrowed from you, and will be doubled in the future.&quot;    LabelSee Chu Feng accept, Chu Yue is a big joy, just casually, did not think about Chu Feng returning her.     &quot;What are you taking? This fairy grass is for you, it is a waste. ”But the face of Chu Zhen can be ugly.     Chu Feng smiled and ignored him, but said to Chu Yue: &quot;Chu Yue sister, I will be participate this year&#39;s internal door assessment.&quot;    &quot;Hey, it depends on you? If you can pass the internal door assessment, this year&#39;s family subsidized fairy grass, I will send you. ”Chu Zhen looked at Chu Feng with disdain.     &quot;Is this true?&quot;Chu Feng does not believe it.     “Chu Yue sister testified, but if you can’t pass?”    &quot;Then my fairy grass this year will be yours.&quot;Chu Feng left this sentence and continued to work in the Outer Sect Disciple.     &quot;Chu Zhen, we are all family, why are you always in a difficult position for Chu Feng?&quot;Chu Yue looked at Chu Zhen unpleasantly.     &quot;family? Chu Yue Sister, you should know that this Chu Feng is not my Chu family. ”    &quot;It is a shame for my Chu family to pass the internal door assessment for five years after entering sect.&quot;    &quot;The whole Chu family, which one likes him? That is why you are so good to him, and he will use his own fairy grass for him. ”Chu Zhen is very puzzled.     &quot;You are really stubborn.&quot;Chu Yue was a little angry, and when he glanced at him, he walked away.     However, Chu Zhen stood in the field and smiled. He was very happy. Although Chu Yue&#39;s fairy grass did not get him, he knew that this year Chu Feng&#39;s fairy grass must be his.     At night, the Outer Sect Disciple is in a dark place.     After a busy day, everyone was very tired and slept early. Only Chu Feng&#39;s room was lit.     He sat on the bed and took out the fairy grass that Chu Yue sent him. He whispered: &quot;I hope this fairy grass can feed you.&quot;    Then, Chu Feng closed his eyes and sandwiched the fairy grass between his palms, pinching out a strange law.     At this moment, the aura in the fairy grass began to flow into the body along Chu Feng&#39;s palm, and finally gathered in Dantian.     At the same time, Chu Feng&#39;s Dan Tian actually came to chew the sound, as if something was eating.     If you pass through the skin, you can find that Chu Feng&#39;s deep in the field, there is a thunderbolt.     This group of lightning is divided into nine colors, each color seems to be a thunder Huge beast, and gives out the terrible atmosphere that does not belong to this world.
