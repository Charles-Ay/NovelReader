    At this moment, the temple was quiet, and everyone’s eyes were directed at Chu Yue.     &quot;Chu Yue, what are you talking about? This kind of thing can not be testified. ”    Chu Wei spoke up, and his eyes contained a strong warning. His meaning was clear, that is, let Chu Yue not talk.     “I didn’t say that when Chu Zhen and Chu Feng were betting, I was there, or Chu Zhen’s brother gave me testimony.”    However, Chu Yue did not fear Chu Wei, but stood beside Chu Feng, as if suggesting that everyone chose to stand on which side.     This time, let alone Chu Zhen, even Chu Cheng Chuwei, including most of the Chu family, his face is green.     They couldn&#39;t think of it, Chu Yue would like to go to Chu Feng, and would like to be right with the Chu family.     In fact, even Chu Feng felt a little surprised. After all, Chu Yue would offend a lot of people, but unexpectedly, Chu Feng is more moved.     &quot;Chu Zhen, are you going to pay?&quot;Chu Feng continued to exert pressure. With Chu Yue testifying, he did not believe that Chu Zhen dared to deny it.     &quot;I ...Chu Zhen&#39;s face is extremely ugly, I don&#39;t know how to answer.     Xianling grass only subsidizes one family per year. Apart from this strain, they have no chance to get such a good spiritual medicine.     This year&#39;s Faerie Grass has just arrived, Chu Zhen is preparing to rely on it to impact the Spirit Realm Fourth Level, how can he be willing to let go.     &quot;Oh, even if this is true.&quot;    “You went to Azure Dragon School with Chu Zhen. Chu Zhen entered the inner door two years ago, but you are two years late.”    &quot;How, it took so long to enter the inner door, are you still proud?&quot; I still want to blackmail Chu Zhen&#39;s family subsidy. ”Chu Cheng sneered at the sophistry. As the pro-big brother of Chu Zhen, he naturally would not let Chu Feng take the subsidy of Little Brother.     &quot;You don&#39;t want to tell me these words. What is going on is what you know about Little Brother.&quot;    &quot;If you want to rely on your account, you can say that Chu Feng can no longer pursue it, but that person has to personally admit that he speaks like fart and has no integrity at all.&quot;Chu Feng is not reluctant.     &quot;you....&quot;When this was said, Chu Zhen’s gnashing teeth could not be refuted because he did not care.     &quot;Haha, joke, repay? Have I said that I have to pay? . ”    &quot;Chu Zhen&#39;s fairy grass can give you, but you have to admit in the face of everyone, you are useless waste, it took five years to become a fool of Inner Sect Disciple.&quot;    &quot;Everyone said, I am right?&quot;Chu Cheng shouted loudly.     &quot;Yes, Chu Cheng’s big brother said yes.&quot;    &quot;Yes, if you want to take the fairy grass, you must admit that you are a waste. As long as you admit it, we should be rewarded with flowers.&quot;And Chu Cheng vibrates and calls, the natural response to the call.     Chu family people, except Chu Yuan, Chu Guyu and Chu Yue, almost no one likes Chu Feng, they all want to drive Chu Feng out of the Chu family.     So as long as it is about Chu Feng&#39;s, no matter how excessive, they will support, they just want to make Chu Feng embarrassed.     &quot;Chu Cheng, you don&#39;t want to make trouble. This is a private matter of Chu Zhen and Chu Feng&#39;s. You are not qualified to interject.&quot;Chu Yue rebuked.     &quot;We are not qualified, are you qualified? As Elder Sister of Chu Zhen, he is facing an outsider. Are you also a Chu family? ”Chu Cheng’s evil bite.     &quot;My Chu Yue is not right, not to mention Chu Feng Little Brother is not an outsider, he is also my Chu family.&quot;    &quot;He is not a Chu family. You know it, but I can tell you that Chu Zhen is your pro-Little Brother.&quot;    &quot;You are quite unreasonable.&quot;Chu Yue was shivering by Chu Chengqi&#39;s body.     At this moment, Chu Feng&#39;s palm rested on Chu Yue&#39;s shoulder and took it behind him.     At the moment, Chu Feng still has an indifferent smile on his face, but his eyes have become fierce, and the faint road:    &quot;I only ask, this fairy grass, you give it or not.&quot;    &quot;Oh, Chu Feng, don&#39;t say that we are hard for you, but you are really not qualified to take Chu Zhen&#39;s fairy grass.&quot;    &quot;Like this, I will give you a chance. You will learn from Chu Zhen. If you can win Chu Zhen, you are qualified to take this fairy grass.&quot;    &quot;Chu Yue, don&#39;t you say that I am not reasonable. I will take out my fairy grass now, as long as Chu Feng can win, it is all his.&quot;During the conversation, Chu Cheng put the fairy grass in his arms on the table.     At the same time, Chu Cheng made a color to Chu Zhen, and Chu Zhen was also the heart of the gods, put his fairy grass on the table.     &quot;Chu Zhen, you have been in the inner door for two years and have been cultivated through two Martial Techniques.&quot;    &quot;Chu Feng has just entered the inner door. Do you feel shameless to learn from him?&quot; You can&#39;t afford to lose. ”Chu Yue is still feeling uncomfortable for Chu Feng.     &quot;Shut up, there is no copy of your voice here.&quot;Chu Cheng pointed to Chu Yue, full of threats, and then looked up at Chu Feng:    &quot;However, if you lose, you must hand over your fairy grass, do you dare?&quot;    At this moment, everyone&#39;s eyes are on Chu Feng, they are waiting for Chu Feng&#39;s answer.     If Chu Feng refuses, they can insult Chu Feng as a coward. If Chu Feng agrees, Chu Zhen will be able to teach Chu Feng better.     In any case, Chu Feng has fallen into the Jedi, and they just want to see how Chu Feng is ugly.     &quot;What are you afraid of?&quot;Chu Feng smiled lightly and calmly.     &quot;Well, have the courage, but let me know in advance, there is no eye in the fists and feet. If anyone is injured, don&#39;t complain.&quot;Chu Cheng laughed more despicable.     &quot;Don&#39;t talk nonsense, you have to call it.&quot;Chu Feng took his fairy grass on the table and then walked toward the center of the hall.     &quot;Chu Feng brother...&quot;Chu Yue took Chu Feng, the flashing eyes, and advised Chu Feng not to compete with Chu Zhen.     However, Chu Feng smiled and pushed Chu Yue&#39;s hand and said only one thing: &quot;Trust me.&quot;    Upon seeing it, Chu Yue couldn&#39;t help but know why, she had an illusion, as if Chu Feng really had the grasp of victory.     Chu Feng and Chu Zhen walked to the center of the main hall. Everyone gathered around and didn&#39;t want to miss Chu Feng&#39;s abused drama.     &quot;Chu Feng, I think you really have to pay for it.&quot;    Chu Zhen, who has been a long time, has finally smiled on his face, but he laughs very hazy.     It was extremely uncomfortable to be forced to take such a slap in the face of Chu Feng. At this moment, there is a chance to learn Chu Feng&#39;s, and naturally he will not keep his hands.     “Oh,” Chu Feng smiled slightly, and then said: “This sentence is carefully I want to tell you.”    &quot;Boastful, I will let you know today how weak you are.&quot;    Chu Zhen&#39;s left foot suddenly stepped forward, only to hear a bang, the whole person is already flying.     He danced with his arms, his fists and shadows fluttered, and his body was out of the air, like a wild beast, forced to Chu Feng.
