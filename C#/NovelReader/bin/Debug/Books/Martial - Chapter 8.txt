    &quot;Yuanmeng never recruits members, but anyone who is seen by them is a dragon among people.&quot;    &quot;Don&#39;t look at the wing league, there are only thirty-two people, but among the inner doors, they are all big names.&quot;    &quot;And the squad is extremely concentric, depending on the members of the hands and feet, dare to move the ally members, no matter who they will revenge.&quot;    &quot;Two years ago, a third-class sect in Azure Province was killed because of a member of the squad, and the precisely flank of the shot.&quot;    &quot;Is it so powerful?&quot;Chu Feng was also surprised to hear that, although the third-class sect is far less than Azure Dragon School, but at least one of the forces, can destroy it, can imagine that the wing is indeed very strong.     &quot;Also, don&#39;t look at the founders of the World League and Kendo League, but compared with the founders of the Wing League, they simply don&#39;t flow.&quot;    &quot;According to legend, the founder of the wing, entered the inner door at the age of eleven, became a core disciple at the age of fourteen, and was the first discriminator of Azure Dragon School at the age of sixteen.&quot;    &quot;Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t want to be at Azure Dragon School. He left here when he was sixteen. No one knows where he is going.&quot;Talking about this, Little Brother is quite sorry.     &quot;What is this person called?&quot;Chu Feng was amazed, core disciple, which is the focus of Azure Dragon School, each of which can be described as a martial cultivation wizard.     And the founder of the Wing League, at the age of sixteen, is invincible between the core disciple, what is the man?     &quot;He is called Zhang Tianyi.&quot;Little Brother said the name word by word.     &quot;Zhang Tianyi.&quot;Chu Feng wrote down the name because he was qualified by Chu Feng.     &quot;Right, I heard that the beauty of my inner door, Elder Su Rou, is the first member of the squad, and was one of the strongest core disciple.&quot;    &quot;And, in addition to Su Rou Elder, among the core disciple, there are also many squadrons. Everyone&#39;s achievements are not inferior to the founders of Tianxiameng and Kendo League. You said that this wing is not good?&quot;Little Brother continues to preach.     &quot;In this way, this wing league is really amazing. So what are the special signs of the wing members?&quot;Chu Feng is more interested in this wing.     “Wingmen’s people are rarely seen, but each of them has a medal on their chest, which is painted with a pair of wings.”Little Brother preached.     The three people walked and talked, and soon arrived at a crowded square, where the registration for spiritual medicine was recorded.     In fact, the so-called registration is to write your own name on the banner of the square, and then extract a token, there is no Elder hospitality.     &quot;This Junior Brother, tomorrow&#39;s spiritual medicine hunting begins, presumably you want to join the alliance for asylum.&quot;    &quot;So I advise you, like the alliance of the wing alliance, don&#39;t think about it, because we can&#39;t get in for a lifetime.&quot;    &quot;Don&#39;t say that the squad, even the League of Heaven and the Kendo League, are not so good.&quot;     &quot;So, if you want to join the alliance, you must keep your eyes open.&quot;After the registration, the brothers came together again.     &quot;Please also ask the two Senior Brothers for guidance.&quot;Seeing this pair of brothers so enthusiastic, Chu Feng can not bear to boast their face.     &quot;Although too strong alliances can&#39;t get in, but you can&#39;t choose too weak, like how good ones are to introduce your own alliances, you can&#39;t enter, these alliances can&#39;t protect you, you can only be bullied.&quot;    &quot;For example, the gimmick that sent bamboo everywhere, at first glance, is a weak alliance, and is deceiving the new discipline.&quot;During the conversation, my brother turned his finger to a place, a purple girl.     Looking at him in the direction he pointed out, Chu Feng could not help but because the purple girl was actually Chu Yue.     &quot;Chu Yue sister.&quot;Upon seeing it, Chu Feng shouted excitedly.     Hearing Chu Feng&#39;s shouting, Chu Yue also looked back and saw the same joy after seeing Chu Feng, waving and shouting: &quot;Chu Feng brother.&quot;    Chu Feng was anxious to find Chu Yue. I couldn’t think of meeting here. I quickly walked over to Chu Yue.     &quot;Oh, it’s over, another fool is being cheated. Let’s talk to him so much. It’s a white talk.”Upon seeing this, the brothers looked at each other and shook their heads.     &quot;Chu Feng, you finally entered the inner door. It’s great, our brother and sister can finally cultivate together.&quot;Looking at the purple robes on Chu Feng, Chu Yue was full of joy and happy, and she jumped up. She was sincerely happy for Chu Feng.     “Chu Yue, what are you doing?”Looking at the bamboo in the hands of Chu Yue, Chu Feng is very curious.     &quot;Hey, you still don&#39;t know, Brother Chu Wei created an alliance inside the door, called Chu Meng.&quot;    &quot;Today, the Chu family&#39;s peers are in this Chu League, but even so, the Chumen people are still too few.&quot;    &quot;This is not, taking advantage of this year&#39;s new discipline to enter the inner door, I want to draw more people to join the Chu League, to strengthen the forces. After all, if the development of the Chu League is good, it will be of great help to the Chu family in the future.&quot;Chu Yue smiled and explained.     Chu Wei, who is in Chu Yue’s mouth, is the youngest generation of the Chu family. At the age of 20, he entered the Azure Dragon School ten years ago.     However, Chu Feng&#39;s impression of Na Chuwei is not good. When he was the most bully of him when he was a child, there was one Chuwei.     &quot;Then I will help you together.&quot;Although he was disgusted with Chu Wei, Chu Feng did not want Chu Yue to be too hard.     &quot;No, I don&#39;t really need it. You don&#39;t know the situation of the Chu League. I can do it myself.&quot;Chu Yue smiled and refused, and asked with concern: &quot;To Chu Feng, this time, you have signed up for the spiritual medicine hunting?&quot;    &quot;Look at this.&quot;Chu Feng smiled and took out the token of the spicy medicine hunting.     &quot;Hah, great. This time, I can go to the grass with Chu Feng, and I told you that catching the grass is a wit-and-work, very interesting.&quot;When it comes to spiritual medicine hunting, Chu Yue looks very much looking forward to it.     &quot;Chu Feng, I am busy first. You come here to find me at night. I have something to tell you, I must come.&quot;    Seeing a newborn discipline pass by, Chu Yue hurriedly put a piece of bamboo into the hands of Chu Feng, and then walked over to the newborn discipline to introduce the things of the Chu League.     See Chu Yue insist on this, Chu Feng is no longer strong, and above the bamboo, it is the location of the Chu Yue House.     Walking in the square, scanning the crowds, and found that like Chu Yue, there is a lot of propaganda of their own alliance.     Only a few people pay attention to them. After all, everyone is not a fool. Unless you really can&#39;t join a powerful alliance, few people will choose to join such a small alliance.     And the so-called Chu Meng, only Chu Yue alone in recruiting members, even the Chu Wei, which created the Chu League, did not appear, it can be seen that for the Chu family, only Chu Yue alone.     In the evening, Chu Feng came to the residence of Chu Yue, and Chu Yue was in the house, apparently in and others.     Seeing Chu Feng, Chu Yue carrying his hands, he jumped and ran over.     Don&#39;t look at Chu Yue, who is one year older than Chu Feng, but also a girl in the flower season. Not only looks sweet, but also cheerful and cheerful.     In the Chu family, Chu Yue can be regarded as a living treasure. No matter how old or small, I like this ghostly gimmick.     When he came to Chu Feng, Chu Yue spread his hands and smiled. &quot;Hey, get it up.&quot;    And between the white palms, it was a fairy grass.
